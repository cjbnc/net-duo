                           Net::Duo To-Do List

Authentication:

 * The sms_passcodes method should return true or undef instead of a
   status and should throw an exception using status_msg on failure, and
   similarly for validate_passcode and auth_status.

 * Consider having validate_out_of_band return an object for an async
   authentication that supports a status method and an id accessor method,
   and can also be constructed from its id.

Test suite:

 * Test::RRA::Duo should dynamically discover the fields that can compared
   with simple comparisons, and the fields that can be compared with
   is_deeply, by analyzing the return of _fields in the relevant class.
